## 🛠️ Getting Started

Follow the steps below to run the project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository

First, fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/react-task.git
cd react-task
Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username.



2. Install project dependencies
Make sure you have Node.js (v14 or later) and npm installed. Then run:
npm install


3. Run the development server
To start the app in development mode:
npm run dev


You should see output like:
